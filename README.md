# Model of Organiztaional Gender Stratification Dyanmics
This repository contains all code necessary to run the computational model and replicate the simulations/results reported in the paper 
> Samuelson, H.L., Levine, B.R., Barth, S.E., Wessel, J.L., & Grand, J.A. (in press). Exploring womenâ€™s leadership labyrinth: Effects of hiring and developmental opportunities on gender stratification. *Leadership Quarterly*.

All code is provided under the GNU GPL and may be freely manipulated and distributed. Citing the original paper if any portions of the model and/or simulation is borrowed, adapted, or used for other purposes is appreciated. There is no expectation for the authors to provide techical guidance or support with troubleshooting, running, or adapting any portions of the provided code.

# File Structure
The material in this repository is organized into two sections:
1. The **base** folder contains all code for running and conducting simulations with the base gender stratification model. This code base  corresponds directly to the model described in Study 1 of the Samuelson et al. paper. *Users wishing to adapt and extend the base functionality of the model should use the code contained in this folder.*
2. The **paperSims** folder contains all code for replicating the virtual experiments, analyses, and figures reported for both Study 1 and Study 2 in the Sameulson et al. paper.

Each folder contains its own README file explaining its content and instructions for using the code. All model and simulation code was constructed in the open-source [R programming environment](https://cran.r-project.org/) and requires the user to have downloaded and installed the latest version of the software to use.
